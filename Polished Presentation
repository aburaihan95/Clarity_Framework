THE CLARITY FRAMEWORK v1.0
A standard for unambiguous AI communication.

Designed for creators, developers, and AI power-users who need absolute confidence in what a model is producing, the Clarity Framework solves the single biggest point of friction in modern AI workflows: intent uncertainty.

Is this code meant to run?  
Is this text a draft or a final?  
Is this policy authoritative or exploratory?  

With four simple, universal mode tags, the Clarity Framework makes every AI output self-describing. It removes ambiguity, reduces errors, prevents mis-execution, and transforms AI into a predictable, collaborative tool.

A future where AI outputs are always clear, structured, and safe begins here.
